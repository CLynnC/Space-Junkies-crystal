Within this project our goal was to set up a informational space themed webpage with a "Build your own launch" mini game.

To do this we used two separate pages. With the first page including a upcoming launches section.

And a map showing the different launch locations in Amercia. Which was also our first inclusion of a web API.

The map includes the catalyst for the user to input there launch details including the location they would like to use and the date of there launch.

The second page is used for the user to get the results of there launch. With the use of a second page we were able to have more room for entertaining and attention grabbing styles.

## Web Api's
We shot above and beyond the stars and decided to use 3 api's to help our webpage function and provide the user with all the information they need to build there launch.

* Stated previously the map was our first Api used, it allows the user to interact and see the positions of launch pad locations in Amercia. ![](2022-12-09-15-49-15.png)

* The second api used on our webpage gets data from the api about launches that are upcoming and displays them on our webpage as a information container.

* We also used a weather api to display in there launch results how the weather would be when the users rocket takes off.

## Local Storage

*The local storage is used when the user inputs there data and hits the Create button.

It stores this data and sends it to the second webpage which then displays a message on the users launch results depending on the information they selected.
